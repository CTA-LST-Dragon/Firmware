ChangeLog

dv5_1_0C_13
- firmware version 0C_11 contained event corruption bug.
It was caused due to 266MHz clock implementation.
Now 266MHz clock was deleted and DRS4 timing calibration clock is only
66.667MHz as before.


dv5_1_0C_11
- DRS4 timing calibration clock frequency changed
It can be selected by bit3 of DRS_CLKOUT_ENABLE (register x1099).
0: 66.667MHz(default), 1: 266.667MHz
Clock signal is injected to 8th input of each DRS4 chip for timing calibration
purpose. 

- SCB test pulse injection mode select
It can be selected by bit8 of SCB_TP_CLKSELECT (register x10CF).
1: test pulse injection starts without necessary to start daq
0: test pulse injection starts after starting daq (default)
To control pulse inject position in DRS4 ring, you should select 0 and change
the position by TRIGGER_FREQ_OFFSET because the timing is determined by when
daq starts and when pulse injection starts.


dv5_1_0C_02
Bug fix for L0 ASIC/delay reset.
Reset pulse width was too short and reset did not work. Changed pulse width to 63usec from 1usec.

dv5_1_0C_00
asynchronous counter for rate(L1/L0/IPR), which counts rising edge of the trigger signals.
FIFO buffer busy threshold is changed
	before) half of the buffer size
	after) one event length + several bytes
new registers
SCB_TP_CLKSELECT x10CF
	generate test pulse trigger from external 10MHz. 
	trigger timing is synchronized in the camera by external pps.
DRS_DWRITE_TO_READY x108E
	busy lowering timing related to DRS4 buffer

dv5_1_0B_0E
Bug fix about busy handling
	befor bug fix) accept trigger -> busy check -> read DRS (if busy, the charge will be lost)
	after) busy check -> accept trigger -> read DRS
new registers
TRIGGER_ENABLE x101E
BUSY_STATE x101F

dv5_1_0B_0C
seperate rate count window for L1R/IPR (RBCP reg x3E-3F)

dv5_1_0B
DRS stop channel reset enable/disable (RBCP reg x9C)
FIRMWARE_SUBVER (reg x02)
timing calibration problem fixed

dv5_1_08
BP FPGA Reboot via SlowControl (RBCP reg X69)

dv5_1_0A
ADC bit loss was fixed.
asynchronous FIFO between 133MHz logic and 66MHz logic

dv5_1_07
for the cluster test
DRS reference clock with external 10MHz (RBCP reg x9D and x9E)

dv5_1_06
for the cluster test
asynchronous trigger
data format header was changed

dv5_1_05
SlowControl register modified
DRS_CASCADENUM: number of cascaded channels (1,2 or 4)

dv5_1_04
BP SPI modified
SlowControl register modified
FIRMWARE_VER
SCB_TP_TRIG_WIDTH
TRIGGER_FREQ_OFFSET

dv5_1
firmware version 1
channel cascade

dv5_0
copied from 20140909hdl_dv4_v2_6
board version 5
firmware version 0
