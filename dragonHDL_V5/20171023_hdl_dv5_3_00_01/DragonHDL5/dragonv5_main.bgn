   has certain restrictions. Make sure that there is no address collision. A
   read/write on one port and a write operation from the other port at the same
   address is not allowed. RAMB16BWER, when both ports are 18 bits wide or
   smaller, A13-6 including A4 cannot be same. When any one port is 36 bits
   wide, A13-7 including A5 cannot be the same. Violating this restriction may
   result in the incorrect operation of the BRAM.
